# EMCC tests
The code here is an experiment which uses the [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://www.libsdl.org/) API to interact with the HTML `<canvas>` element via WebAssembly. The C++ source code comes from the official [Emscripten repo](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/tests/hello_world_sdl.cpp) with some minor modifications, such as the removal of console logs.
